Hash Rate Test Script: In-Depth Explanation ðŸ“Š
How It Works
The Hash Rate Test Script is designed to simulate various levels of hash computation complexity, providing a comprehensive measure of your systemâ€™s performance. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the test operates:

Intensity Levels
The intensity parameter in the simulate_hash_work function allows you to control the complexity of the hash calculations. It impacts the number of iterations and the variety of hashing algorithms used:

Low Intensity: Simulates a simpler blockchain workload (e.g., Litecoin). Performs fewer hash calculations per iteration.
Iterations: 100
Medium Intensity: Represents a standard blockchain workload (e.g., Ethereum). Balances performance and complexity.
Iterations: 1000
High Intensity: Simulates a more complex blockchain workload (e.g., Bitcoin). Executes more hash calculations per iteration.
Iterations: 10,000
Iterations
The iterations variable defines how many times the hashing process is repeated during the test. This parameter directly affects the total number of hashes processed:

Number of Hashes: Calculated as intensity_iterations * total_iterations.
For example, if you set:

intensity = "high"
iterations = 3000
The script will perform a total of 10,000 * 3000 = 30,000,000 hash calculations.

Breakdown of Results
Hash Rate: Measures the number of hashes per second. Higher intensity and more iterations generally result in a lower hash rate, as the workload increases.
Average Time Per Hash: Indicates the average time taken to perform a single hash computation.
Min and Max Time for a Single Hash: Provides insights into the best and worst-case performance during the test.
Memory Usage: Monitors how memory consumption changes before and after the test.
Sample Output
When you run the script, youâ€™ll see detailed metrics including:

Total Time Taken: How long the test took to complete.
Hash Rate: The efficiency of your system in terms of hashes per second.
Average and Extreme Hash Times: Performance statistics for hash computations.
System Metrics: CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, network I/O, and more.
Why This Matters
Performance Testing: Assess how well your system handles hash calculations and identify any performance bottlenecks.
System Monitoring: Track system resource usage to optimize performance and maintain your setup.
Educational Value: Learn about the impact of hash intensity and iterations on system performance in a practical, interactive way.
Whether you're testing your hardware, monitoring system performance, or just exploring how different intensities affect hash calculations, this script offers valuable insights and detailed reporting.
